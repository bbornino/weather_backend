weather_code_map.py

This module provides a complete mapping of WMO (World Meteorological Organization)
international weather condition codes to human-readable descriptions. These codes are
used by major weather data providers (including Open-Meteo, Meteostat, and others)
to standardize weather condition reporting. This map allows all weather scrapers
and data processors in the project to share a common reference.
